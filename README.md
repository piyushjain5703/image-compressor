# image-compressor
image compressor using kMeans  clustering with 30 colors(no. of cluster).  
I used unsupervised machine learning algorithm knowns as K-Means clustring with number of cluster = 30.
  Here, No. of cluster decides the quility of your image :
  
             **no. of cluster ‚àù 1/(image quality)**
